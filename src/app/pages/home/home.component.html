    <p>This is a small bit of coding I've put together to show my coding style. It is comprised of a few components, which utilize ControlValueAccessor.</p>

They currently do not have the ability to enable/disable via Reactive forms, but that's because <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/angular-template-forms-superior-reactive-chris-stanley-ub1oc/">Template Driven Forms are far superior.</a></p>
    <p>Note: I only just started this site on 11/11/2024, so it's not completed.</p>
